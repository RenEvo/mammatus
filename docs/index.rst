Mammatus Private Cloud
====================================

Mammatus is a private cloud implementation aimed at being hosted on low powered single board computers (SBC) such as the Raspberry Pi, ODROID, Pine64, etc... 
Idealistically this is a plug and play by following the instructions provided in this repository.

.. warning:: I am not a technical writer, and this is documentation is not intended to be used as a "how to build a production cloud". This is a hobby project of mine and I am putting this documentation up for research purposes for the things I have learned about the covered topics.
